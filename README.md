Initially this was a part of my Pulumi configs, but as the scope and usability expanded it made more sense for it to be a library instead.
It's fully functional for what it seeks to do, which is provide an idiomatic way of expressing infrastructure as code through a familiar LISP style.

The goal isn't to limit functionality, but instead expand behavior and usage patterns by providing the full power functionality of Clojure through composability and metaprogramming.

The best example of usage are [my own infrastructure configs](https://github.com/GigiaJ/iac-cljs-configs#)


I'll detail more later (check my config README if you're desperate to get this alpha build running).
